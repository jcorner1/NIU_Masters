# Convective Mode Classification Using Machine Learning Techniques
## Introduction
Convective mode highly correlates with certain hazards (<a href="https://journals.ametsoc.org/view/journals/wefo/27/5/waf-d-11-00115_1.xml">Smith et al. 2012</a>). Efforts to automate the classification of storm mode are important for forecasters and climatologists alike. Works have been present in the literature to use various methods of machine learning to do this task (<a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/808201">Alexiuk et al. 1999</a>; <a href="https://rmets.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1017/S1350482704001409">Anagnostou 2004</a>; <a href="https://journals.ametsoc.org/view/journals/atot/26/7/2008jtecha1205_1.xml">Gagne et al. 2009</a>; <a href="https://journals.ametsoc.org/view/journals/atot/39/7/JTECH-D-21-0141.1.xml">Potvin et al. 2022</a>; <a href="https://ams.confex.com/ams/101ANNUAL/meetingapp.cgi/Paper/379132"> Sobash et. al 2021</a>). The goal of this project is to show some forms of machine learning and how it is used to classify the convective mode of storms. 

## Methods
- **1st Step: Download Data** - To begin we must download sometime of high resolution reflectivity data. The one used in this project uses Multi-Sensor/Multi-Radar (MRMS) data from <a href="https://mesonet.agron.iastate.edu/GIS/rasters.php?rid=4">Iowa State Univeristy Mesonet Page</a>. An example of how to download this data can be found here. This example also provides a method of download HRRR data which can also be used for identfying convective mode.
- **2nd Step: Find Convective Objects & Attributes** - Next, we must find the convective objects (i.e., thunderstorms) and attributes associated with the size, shape, etc. of these objects. A notebook on finding the objects and their attributes can be found <a href="https://github.com/jcorner1/NIU_Masters/blob/main/Masters_Thesis/METplus/MODE_stuff/Storm_Identification_MRMS.ipynb">here</a>. 
- **3rd Step: Label the Dataset** - Now, labeling convective objects is done by the user so that a model can be trained to identfy what an indivual percieves. The notebook that allows for labeling a dataset can be found <a href="https://github.com/jcorner1/NIU_Masters/blob/main/Masters_Thesis/Machine_Learning/MRMS_Storm_Mode_Labeling.ipynb">here</a>.
- **4th Step: Preprocessing of Data** - For different types of machine learning require different methods of preprocessing data. Higher level algorithms (ANNs, CNNs) require more work prior to the implementation of the model. More information on how and when to do this can be found <a href="https://letmegooglethat.com/?q=Preprocessing+and+machine+learning">here</a> 
- **5th Step: Machine Learning** - Finally, we do the machine learning part of the project. In this case we do both a decision tree and a random forest. This example is found <a href="https://github.com/jcorner1/NIU_Masters/blob/main/GEOG771/Final_Project/flora_type_machine_learning_Storm_Mode.ipynb">here</a>.
